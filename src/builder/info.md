Whenever you want to create objects step by step ,all those complex objects you have to create step by step. At that time we will use Builder Design Pattern. 
Lombok has a annotation @Builder which will create a builer pattern for the class.

The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. This pattern is especially useful when an object needs to be created in a specific sequence or when the creation process involves a lot of steps, parameters, or optional configurations.
