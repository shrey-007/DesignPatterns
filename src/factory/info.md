Based on the parameters passed , we are going to decide which type of object we want to create.  
Another example of this is -:
Suppose TATA company makes 2 types of vehicles electric and diesel, now there is a car(NEXON) which can be of type petrol also and diesel also.  
Now we have to create NEXON car on basis of input provided by user , If user gives electric then we have to made electric Nexon else if user gives diesel as input then we have to make diesel NEXON.
